## Debt payoff calculator, a work in progress

Enter your debts, along with their balances, interest rates, and minimum monthly payments, and see how long it will take to pay them off through an interactive chart. You can visualize how long it will take to pay off your individual debts, or how long it will take to pay off your debts in total.

If you're willing and able to pay a little bit extra each month, you can also specify an accelerator amount. An accelerator amount is the money you pay on top of your minimum payments. This calculator will automatically allocate that amount towards your highest-interest debts.

## Coming Soon

Option to prioritize debts by lowest balance first. This payoff method allows users to get rid of their smaller debts as quickly as possible, and is popularly known as the Snowball method. While it is not as financially efficient as paying down the highest-interest debts first, it can have a powerful psychological effect and gives users one less thing to worry about with each debt paid.

Option to show individual payment schedules per debt, and to allow users to download data in an Excel spreadsheet.
