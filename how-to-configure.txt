npm -init: say yes to everything
git -init: already done.

npm install --save a bunch of stuff
react, react-router

maybe not save right off the bat if I'm testing out environments. I can re-install later with --save.

configure a local eslint
configure local testing apps (probs mocha + jasmine + chai) --save-dev

run npm outdated to see what's behind
run npm update to bring comptabile releases up to speed


For Testing, use Mocha + Chai. It's what the Full-Stack Voting app tutorial used.
